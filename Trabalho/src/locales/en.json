    "originStory": "In 2015, a small group of Python enthusiasts in São Carlos realized the need to create a local space to share knowledge and experiences about this language that was growing rapidly in the Brazilian tech scene. Inspired by Python user groups (GruPys) that already existed in other cities like São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Campinas, we decided to found Grupy São Carlos with the goal of democratizing access to Python knowledge in the region. What started as informal meetings in cafes and borrowed rooms quickly evolved into a structured community that is now a reference in the interior of São Paulo state.",
